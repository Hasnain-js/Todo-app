# Todo-app
A TODO app using Next.js frontend and Express.js backend is a web application that enables users to create and manage a list of tasks. The frontend is built using Next.js and communicates with the backend through an API endpoint. The backend, built using Express.js, provides a RESTful API and interacts with a database using an ORM library.
